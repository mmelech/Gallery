{#
This is a template fragment designed to be included in other templates
See http://symfony.com/doc/current/book/templating.html#including-other-templates

A common practice to better distinguish between templates and fragments is to
prefix fragments with an underscore. That's why this template is called
'_flash_messages.html.twig' instead of 'flash_messages.html.twig'
